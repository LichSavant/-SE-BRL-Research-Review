# Master completion sprint - November 4, 2026

The sprint completed additional software preparation, audit, verification and
handoff work. **It did not complete a scientifically frozen thesis prototype or
produce new empirical research results.** Current HEAD remains `6bded57`; real
data/experimental gates remain unresolved. There is no claim of genuine 16/16.

## Independently checked repository and environment

Checkout `C:/Users/Dhanwil/Desktop/Projects/Thesis_Prototype_Git`;
branch main; HEAD `6bded57d38e9b83ba718d7795b97e2130128c23f`;
upstream origin/main. origin is configured to Thesis_Protoype_Test.git and se-brl
to CS4101-Thesis2-SE-BRL.git. No synchronization, remote/config change, commit,
staging or push occurred.

Initial working status was 22 unstaged tracked paths and 26 untracked files.
A 250-file baseline protects existing tracked/untracked research/software,
all experiment/database files and Git index/config. Existing nineteen LFS
materializations and Notebook 01/03/04 edits were retained. Only two existing
preparation modules were intentionally modified; all historical research files
are preserved. Final preservation details are in artifact_inventory.json.

Existing .venv: Python 3.12.10, pytest 8.4.2, FastAPI 0.141.1, Pydantic 2.13.5.
numpy/pandas/scipy/scikit-learn/xgboost/torch/transformers are absent. No
installation/environment replacement occurred. Node dependencies already existed.
No credentials, raw Email content or historical prediction/outcome rows were
inspected. Tests used in-memory SQLite, suppressed Python/pytest caches and
task-owned temporary/build storage.

## Results by evidence category

| Category | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| VERIFIED SOFTWARE RESULT | 906 Python tests, 25 frontend tests, both TypeScript checks, production extension/dashboard builds and 275 static notebook cells passed |
| VERIFIED SOFTWARE RESULT | Fresh D9/UCI finite-numeric rejection, synthetic CV/OOF/ablation/metric/benchmark/bundle paths validated |
| VERIFIED DATA RESULT | Eight raw/clean header/hash pairs match tracked LFS objects; four supplied historical metadata manifests have unique IDs/no recorded group crossings |
| HISTORICAL RESULT | Saved LR experiment manifest, old preprocessing populations and prior outcomes remain historical and unmodified; no performance values used |
| SYNTHETIC RESULT | Fixture-only E1/E2/E3, four dimension omissions, separate technical U1 and timing smoke bundle; zero real research models fitted |
| PENDING SCIENTIFIC APPROVAL | Source eligibility/labels/lineage/groups/dictionaries, exposure/claim policy, selection settings and transformer/title disposition |
| BLOCKED | Real preparation/model training/comparison/calibration/selection/sealed evaluation and scientifically frozen release |
| VERIFIED EMPIRICAL RESULT | None produced in this sprint |

The categories are separate; software and synthetic evidence do not establish
data eligibility or empirical model effectiveness.

## Files and implementation

Existing files changed:
`ml/development_experiments.py` and `ml/uci_preparation.py`, solely to share stable
finite-numeric validation including unrepresentable integer overflow.

New modules:
`ml/evaluation_metrics.py`, `ml/development_runner.py`,
`ml/inference_benchmark.py`, `ml/synthetic_demo.py`.

New tests:
`ml/tests/test_evaluation_metrics.py`,
`ml/tests/test_development_runner.py`,
`ml/tests/test_numeric_boundaries.py`,
`ml/tests/test_inference_benchmark.py`,
`ml/tests/test_synthetic_demo.py`.

No notebook, dataset, assignment, historical result, decision record, persistent
database, extension/dashboard/backend source or wire contract was modified.

## What is finished and what is not

Software preparation now includes explicit binary metrics/undefined cases,
group-preserving paired uncertainty, matched five-fold E1/E2/E3/U1 callback
orchestration, fresh fold pipelines, exact OOF IDs, dimension/family omissions,
fixed-classifier representation comparisons, one-class source slices, synthetic
model-only timing and hashed exclusive replayable outputs.

The runner is synthetic-only, with external trusted pipeline callbacks. Four
family names are supported slots, not four genuine model implementations.
Research estimator factories, nested tuning/search, cross-fitted calibrators,
selection hierarchy implementation with accepted settings, selected-model
integration, real feature dictionaries, actual source-to-feature conformance and
final analytical release are not complete.

The runtime remains explicitly incomplete/fail-closed; existing rule-based/mock
UI output is not relabeled model-generated. No validated model, probability,
attribution, operational threshold or final risk policy is fabricated.
Passing frontend/backend/build checks is not live Gmail or released-model
end-to-end validation.

## Dataset, grouping, leakage and modality findings

The historical Email manifest includes CEAS while current approved primary
construction does not. Nazario supplies constructed positives and Enron/
SpamAssassin ham negatives; source identity is correlated with target. Explicit
source exclusion from predictor columns does not remove content/format shortcuts.

Historical metadata isolation checks do not prove full template/campaign/domain
independence. UCI predictor-vector grouping and PhiUSIIL exact domain grouping
need their source-permitted scientific limitation/acceptance. No new relationship
or assignment is invented. Original raw-to-clean row identity/attrition remains
incomplete. No genuine current development handoff is present.

PhiUSIIL/UCI are independent U1 benchmarks. The approved content-bearing Web
payload is not identified, and technical fields cannot replace its content or
behavioral evidence. ISCX stays outside active approved exports; the abandoned
dataset remains excluded. No new dataset is acquired.

Historical test exposure and the prior documented raw-diagnostic incident remain
part of custody/claim review. No source/feature/model/threshold was chosen from
old outcomes in this sprint. A new seed or validator cannot reseal old data.

## Manuscript-ready technical statements and limits

Supported statements: this sprint implemented and tested the described software
interfaces; recorded payload identities/schemas; verified supplied metadata
barriers; preserved historical research; and documented unresolved methodological
differences. Report exact test counts/commands and label all fixture outputs.

Unsupported statements: that SE-BRL is scientifically frozen, a transformer was
implemented/validated, four candidate classifiers were empirically compared,
fusion improves phishing detection, labels/provenance/groups were scientifically
accepted, calibration/efficiency requirements were met by real models, old holdout
is untouched, or the full integrated analytical prototype has passed final
research/system validation.

Threats to validity include source-label/format shortcuts, unknown lineage and
duplicate relationships, unavailable content/identity/language evidence,
rule circularity if reused as supposed independent labels, historical exposure,
unfrozen metric/calibration/selection settings, environment mismatch and absent
content-bearing Web evidence. Passing software checks does not remove these.

## Prioritized approvals and minimum path

1. Confirm the governing deterministic method/title or approve a specific
   transformer amendment. A transformer is not required to progress under the
   currently approved deterministic method.
2. For the first chosen branch, obtain source/access/license/class definitions,
   original-ID screening/attrition, accepted groups/split and exposure-aware
   claims. UCI-S02's exact retained Result definition is still a specific missing
   evidence item; no approval can substitute for factual provenance.
3. Freeze that branch's ordered predictor/evidence dictionary and development-only
   delivery scope. Do not require every unrelated H item to fix software.
4. Freeze candidate budgets/nesting, score/calibration/uncertainty conventions,
   approved requirements and efficiency environment before comparative research
   fits; no numeric SRS limits are invented.
5. Authorize the named no-fit dataset-to-feature/D9 verification first. Then add
   genuine family adapters and the accepted experiment protocol, run approved
   development-only comparisons, and separately freeze/evaluate the selected
   calibrated/system bundle under an accepted exposure-aware plan.

Shortest legitimate next action: have Dhanwil and Vera resolve one branch-specific
source/label/group/dictionary/access acceptance packet and the governing-method
disposition, starting with retained UCI class-definition evidence if UCI is the
chosen first branch. This unlocks a bounded no-fit verification; no current
instruction authorizes bypassing those missing facts.

Dhanwil owns technical pipeline/runner/reproducibility and tests; Vera/source
custodian supplies existing source and behavioral-specification evidence; joint
researchers/adviser resolve scientific eligibility, deviations and claim scope.
No message to another person was sent and no institutional approval was inferred.

## Final safety / handoff

No real analytical notebook, actual-data preparation, model/calibrator training,
research OOF prediction, final metrics or sealed-test evaluation was run.
Research artifacts remain preserved; the only generated scores/metrics are
explicit synthetic fixtures in a new documentation namespace. No commit/push,
reset/clean, branch switch, fetch/pull or Git configuration/index change.

Use progress.json for acceptance criteria, dependencies and responsible owners;
experiment_readiness.md for exact commands/replay and limitations; and the
existing UCI acceptance packet for granular unresolved evidence. Final
scientific freeze remains false.
